                    <b>Microsoft</b> , is a multinational computer technology corporation. 
                    Microsoft was founded on April 4 , 1975 , by <b>Bill Gates</b> and 
                    <b> Paul Allen in Albuquerque , New Mexico</b>. It's current best - 
                    selling products are the<b> Microsoft Windows Operating System ; 
                    Microsoft Office , </b> a suite of productivity software.

                    In 1980 , Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to bundle Microsoft's 
                    operating system with IBM computers. IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for 
                    every sale. In 1985 , IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new operating 
                    system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft produced that operating 
                    system , but also continued to sell their own alternative , which proved 
                    to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually 
                    overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales.
